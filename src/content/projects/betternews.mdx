**BetterNews** is a performant, full-stack Hacker News clone designed to showcase modern web development best practices — from optimistic UI updates to type-safe APIs — all built with cutting-edge tools like Hono, Bun, and TanStack libraries.

It features a clean, responsive interface, a robust backend with PostgreSQL, Drizzle ORM, and session-based auth using Lucia. Posts, comments, sorting, and voting are all implemented with URL-first design using TanStack Router, and validation is enforced across the stack using Zod.

## Features

- Responsive UI with React + Shadcn/UI + TailwindCSS
- Optimistic upvoting for posts and comments
- Nested commenting system with pagination
- Full auth flow using Lucia (signup, login, logout)
- URL-driven filtering and sorting (recent, top, etc.)
- Form handling via TanStack Form + Zod (type-safe)
- PostgreSQL via Drizzle ORM with schema-first approach

## Tech Stack Highlights

- **Frontend:** React, TanStack Router, TanStack Query, TanStack Form, Shadcn/UI, TypeScript, Zod
- **Backend:** Hono (Bun), Lucia, Drizzle ORM, PostgreSQL, Zod

## Development Practices

- Monolithic repo with clearly separated server and client folders
- Custom error boundaries and toast-based user feedback
